# portfolio-backend-deployed

## https://khem-portfolio.herokuapp.com/

# This project is entirely done for displaying my own personal portfolio by using the following technologies:

- NodeJS, Express, ES6, JSX Syntaxing (Backend)
- MogoDB
- ReactJS, Material UI, Boot Strap, Google Map

# Important features:

- Json Web Token authorizes the user
- Only the user with access token is authorized to log in
- Logged in user can only do:
  - Add/Delete his/her profile information, experiences and can send messages
- User cannot delete other users' items but can only view: list view or comprehensive view

# To run this project

- npm install
- nodemon index.js or
  - node_modules/.bin/nodemon index.js or
  - node index.js or
  - npm start

[Run Locally](http://localhost:3000/)

# Rooms for improvement:

- Project still needs better usability, looks
- Testing is underway
- User creation can be done from either backend or Postman only, at the moment
- More rooms for improvement as my further self-assignment :)
